## Push Nodes

Push Nodes are the central piece of the network that enables the blockchain of web3 notifications to work. In essence, they are validators that can be run by anyone in the future with staking and slashing

### 3 main tasks of Push Nodes
1. **Listening**: Push Nodes listens to EPNS Communicator smart contracts on every blockchain. They also enable off-chain or direct communication via API calls either from a backend or a dapp. This enables EPNS to support just about any web3 service… ie: smart contracts, dapps, backends or direct payloads.

2. Validating and Governing: The communication which is driven by the EPNS Communicator layers require validation. This validation involves ensuring that whether or not the channel exists, the channel is not spamming, the channel is cross-chain verified.le governance and to verify the existence of the channel.
3. Admitting to Network / Dispatching: Lastly, the Push Nodes admit these notifications that are tied to wallet address in the network, which can then be tapped into by any crypto frontend / wallet to display them. The dispatch functionality is also present in these nodes to allow bridging of web3 notifications to be displayed in web2 apps in case the wallet / frontend / software wants to enable that instead of handling direct socket connection.
