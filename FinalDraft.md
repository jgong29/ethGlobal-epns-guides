## What is EPNS

## 1. Introduction Section
---
[Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS)](https://epns.io/?ref=devguide) is the world’s first decentralized communication & notification protocol for web3.

Using the protocol, any smart contract, dapp, or backend service can send on-chain or off-chain notifications tied to the wallet addresses of users in a gasless, multichain, open, and platform-agnostic way.

Being an open communication middleware, notifications can be integrated and shown on any crypto wallet, mobile app, browser extension, or dapps enabling a native communication layer for web3.


## Questions
1. What layer of web3 is EPNS?
    * Communication [✅]
    * Computation
    * Storage
    * Data relay

2. Does sending notification always require gas fees?
    * Yes, always
    * No, (only for on-chain notifications) [✅]

3. What problem does EPNS aim to solve?
    * Enable communication between web3 users
    * Protect users from spam and irregular communication and uphold user privacy
    * Enable web3 and web3 users to interact using their wallet addresses in a decentralized fashion
    * All of the above [✅]

# What are Channels?
Any user who activates themselves as a service on the protocol to send notifications for its users can be considered a Channel.

In other words, any service, i.e., a dapp, protocol, or even a web2 service, that wants to send notifications out to its web3 users can choose to become a channel and establish an adequate communication bridge with its users.

The creation of a channel is just a one-time simple procedure. It must be noted that channel creation only happens on the Ethereum blockchain and one wallet address can only create one channel only the protocol.

> ***Note: Although channel creation only happens on the Ethereum blockchain, the protocol is designed to be chain-agnostic, i.e., channel owners can choose to send notification on any chain of their choice and not just Ethereum network***

A successfully created channel can send notifications to its subscribers, directly tied to their wallet addresses.

Once any user opts in and becomes a subscriber for a channel, that person will receive notifications from that channel directly in their inbox.
Users who are not a subscriber of a particular channel, receive notifications from that channel in their spam box.

> ***Opting In or opting out of a channel is a completely gasless transaction and requires no fees.***

## Questions
1. On which chain, does the channel creation happen?
    * Polygon
    * Ethereum [✅]
    * None of the above.

2. Can you send notifications only on Ethereum blockchain?
    * Yes, it’s restricted to the Ethereum blockchain only.
    * No, EPNS notifications are chain-agnostic and not tied only to Ethereum. [✅]

2. What happens if the user receives notifications from an unsubscribed channel?
    *  The user will not get that Notification.
    *  The user will receive the notification in the inbox.
    *  The notification will go to the User's Spam Box. [✅]

# Notifications

Any successfully created channel, in its active state,  can send notifications to its subscribers about a wide range of things related to DeFi, governance proposals, web3 news, or any other crucial updates about their protocol/services.

Notifications land in the inbox of those users who are subscribed to the channel. Non-subscribers of a particular channel aren't alerted about notifications from that channel as they land in their spam box.

### Types of Notifications
1. **Broadcast Notifications**: This type of notification is basically broadcasted or sent to all the subscribers of a channel at once.

2. **Targeted Notifications**: As the name suggests, this type of notification allows channel owners to notify a specific wallet address.

3. **Subset Notifications**: Subset notifications are quite helpful when a particular group of subscribers of a channel is supposed to be notified.

## What are Delegated Notifications?

Delegated notifications is a feature that allows channel owners to delegate their power of sending notifications to any other wallet address or multiple wallets of their choice.

Once approved by the channel owner, a wallet address can send notifications on behalf of the channel to its subscribers. The channel owner can, however, revoke the approval at any given time.

This mechanism of sending delegated notifications is quite effective in providing value-added services to the channels. It also ensures the availability of mechanisms that can be used by EPNS or any other third-party infrastructure to send on-chain notifications on the channel’s behalf.

## Questions
1. Which one of these is false about EPNS Notifications?
    * They can be sent for Ethereum-based projects only [✅]
    * They come with a clickable Call-to-Action link
    * They take almost no time to trigger

2. What kind of notifications can you send through EPNS?
    * Subset
    * Broadcast
    * Targeted
    * All of the above. [✅]

3. Which one of the following is false about Delegated Notifications?
    * Channel owner can delegate notification sending power to any Wallet address
    * The Delegated wallet address can send notification on behalf of the channels
    * Once approved, a delegated wallet address cannot be removed by channel owner. [✅]
    * Delegated notification are sent on the behalf of the channel address instead of the delegated wallet address.

# EPNS Smart Contracts

In order for the protocol to be chain-agnostic as well as truly decentralized, EPNS smart contracts play a major role.
The EPNS Protocol has now been divided into two different smart contracts, i.e., EPNS Core & EPNS Communicator.

**1. EPNS Core Contract:**
The EPNS Core protocol, as the name might indicate, is the main smart contract as it handles some of the most crucial features like Channel creation, governance, channel state changes as well as funds and incentive mechanisms, etc.
It’s very important to note, however, that the EPNS Core smart contract will only be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and not on any other chain.

**2. EPNS Communicator Contract:**
Unlike the EPNS Core smart contract, the communicator protocol is designed to be deployed on multiple chains. This is also one of the imperative reasons behind the communicator contract being lightweight and not reliant on the core contract.

The EPNS Communicator protocol is comparatively quite simple. The communicator protocol includes features that allow users to subscribe to a channel, unsubscribe from a channel as well as the imperative one, i.e., sending notifications. As the communicator protocol can be deployed on various chains, it allows us to trigger notifications on multiple chains and not just the Ethereum blockchain.

## Questions
1. Which contract is responsible for governance as well as incentive mechanisms?
    * EPNS Core [✅]
    * EPNS Communicator

2. To what extent is EPNS Communicator contract dependent on EPNS Core?
    * Very heavily dependent.
    * Doesn't need to interact with core at all. [✅]

3. Which of the following is not true about EPNS Core contract
    * It can only be deployed on Ethereum
    * Core contract deals with creation of channels
    * Subscribing or unsubscribing features are built in the core contract.[✅]
    * None of the above.

## Push Nodes

Push Nodes are the central piece of the network that enables the blockchain of Web3 notifications to work. In essence, they are validators that can be run by anyone in the future with staking and slashing

![](https://i.imgur.com/zY9YqmS.png)

### 3 main tasks of Push Nodes
1. **Listening**: Push Nodes listens to EPNS Communicator smart contracts on every blockchain. They also enable off-chain or direct communication via API calls either from a backend or a dapp. This enables EPNS to support just about any web3 service… ie: smart contracts, dapps, backends or direct payloads.

2. Validating and Governing: The communication which is driven by the EPNS Communicator layers require validation. This validation involves ensuring that whether or not the channel exists, the channel is not spamming, the channel is cross-chain verified.le governance and to verify the existence of the channel.

3. Admitting to Network / Dispatching: Lastly, the Push Nodes admit these notifications that are tied to wallet address in the network, which can then be tapped into by any crypto frontend / wallet to display them. The dispatch functionality is also present in these nodes to allow bridging of Web3 notifications to be displayed in Web2 apps in case the wallet / frontend / software wants to enable that instead of handling direct socket connection.


## Questions
1. Which feature of Push Nodes enables EPNS protocol to support about any Web3 service?
    * Validating and Governing
    * Listneing to on-chain and off-chain communication [✅]
    * Dispatching
    * None of the above

2. Does Push Node listen to EPNS Communicator smart contract on Ethereum blockchain only?
    * Yes.
    * No. [✅]

3. How is **Dispatch functionality of Push Nodes**, helpful?
    * Enables Gasless notifications
    * Bridges the gap between Web3 notifications and Web3 apps [✅]
    * Enhances speed of notification delivery
    * All of the above.

# Creating a Channel

Creating a channel is the very first step for sending notifications via EPNS.

Any wallet which activates itself on the EPNS Protocol to send a notification is called a Channel.

Using the EPNS dApp or our smart contracts, anyone with a wallet address on the Ethereum network can create their own channel. It can be deployed on;
* The Ethereum Mainnet (via[ Prod dapp](https://app.epns.io/)), or
* Kovan Test Network (via [Staging dapp](https://staging-app.epns.io/))

## Requirements for Setting Up a Channel
Ideally, there are 6 crucial requirements for creating a Channel.

1. A Channel Name
2. Channel Logo (an image of size 128px * 128px)
3. Alias Network (required for multi-chain, for example, if on Polygon, provide Polygon address of your contract, else can be left blank, currently supports only Polygon).

> *Important: This field needs to be provided at the very start in case you want to enable your channel on other blockchain networks, see  for guides and to understand the process.*

4. A brief Channel Description (250 Characters)
5. Channel CTA (Call-to-Action link)
6. An amount of 50 DAI in your Wallet (and some ETH )

> *If you are setting up a Channel on Staging dApp, you can get Free DAI and Kovan ETH from the dApp & online faucets. No need for real DAI/ETH on the Staging app 😁*

## Enabling Channel on Other Chain
As previously mentioned, although channel creation happens on Ethereum itself, the protocol is designed to enable the channel to send notification on any chain.

This is exactly where Channel Alias set-up plays a major role.

### What is Channel Alias?
In order to enable your channel to be blockchain-agnostic and allow multi-chain communication, we have introduced a new term called Channel Alias. This property is what enables your channel to send notifications on any other blockchain.

In simpler terms, a channel alias address is a native representation of your Ethereum channel on any other EVM or Non-EVM chain through which you wish to communicate with your subscribers.

This means that although channel creation must happen on the Ethereum blockchain itself, notifications or communications can be carried out on any other chain through the same channel if the channel has its alias address adequately configured for that particular chain.

You can communicate with your subscribers on Polygon, BSC, Solana, etc. using an Alias address that is compatible with that respective blockchain.

### How to set up Channel Alias?
Now that we understand channel alias, it's time to understand how one set up their channel alias address for any other chain.

In order to set-up channel alias address for any preferred chain, one has to go through 2 simple steps:
* Selecting the chain and providing the right alias address for the channel during channel creation itself.
* Verification of the alias Address on the selected chain.

### How to set up Channel Alias?
In order to set-up channel alias address for any preferred chain, one has to go through 2 simple steps:

* Selecting the chain and providing the right alias address for the channel during channel creation itself.
* Verification of the alias Address on the selected chain.

## Questions:
1. Is Creating a channel a mandatory step to receive notifications?
    * Yes, one cannot Receive notification without a Channel.
    * No, channel is only required to Send notifications, not to receive them.[✅]

2. Which of the following indicates the significance of Channel Alias address?
   * An alias address helps send gas less Notifications
   * Alias address allows channel owner to delegate notification sending power easily.
   * Alias address enables a channel to send notifications on more than one chain.[✅]
   * Alias address allows channel to customize notification designs.

 3. Where does a channel need to verify its Alias Address?
   * Verification of alias address for any chain must happen on Ethereum chain only.
   * On the selected chain for which Alias address was provided, during channel creation.[✅]
   * It can be verified on any chain.
   * None of the above.

# Sending Notifications

Who can Send Notifications?
As per the current design of the protocol, there can be 3 main actors who can send notifications:
1. **Channel Owners**: The owners of a particular channel can send notifications to their subscribers.

3. **Delegate Notification Senders**: Channel owners can allow any particular wallet address to send notifications on behalf of his/her channel. This feature is called delegated notifications.

4. **Notifications To Yourself**: The EPNS Communicator allows any address to send notifications to themselves 😃 It’s important to note, however, that the address sends the notification to themselves only.

> **Note:**
> *Sending notifications is a **gasless** transaction and therefore notification senders need not pay any gas fee while sending notifications via the Dapp.*
>
> *Gas Fees are only applicable when on-chain notifications are triggered directly from smart contracts.*


## How to trigger and send notifications

EPNS protocol provides many ways to trigger a notification. For instance, a channel owner or delegate can trigger notifications using:

1. [EPNS Dapp](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/sending-notifications/dapp-serverless-workflow)
The dapp provides a simple user interface for channel owner to trigger any type of notification they want for their subscribers.

2. [Using EPNS SDK](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-tooling/epns-sdk)
Using the notification, one can not only send notifications of all types, but also fecth a notifications for wallet and use the sdk features to integrate notifications into their own frontends.

3. [Using Subgraph](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/sending-notifications/using-subgraph)
EPNS has developed an in-house Helper Function specifically for The Graph Protocol that allows you to read events from the Subgraph and define notifications accordingly.
Once defined, they will be stored on the Subgraph in a Long String format.
EPNS Push Nodes can, later on, fetch the notifications defined on a Subgraph and push them accordingly to Subscribers of the Channel.

4. [Using Showrunners](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/sending-notifications/using-showrunners-scaffold-gasless)
The showrunners framework is a scaffold that developers can use to build out notifications for their use cases. Showrunners framework provides the tools and helpers required for constructing the payload and sending the notification using the EPNS infrastructure.

## Questions:

1. How can one trigger an on-chain transaction?
    * Using the dapp
    * Using the EPNS Communicator Smart Contract [✅]
    * Using SDK
    * All of the above.

2. How can someone integrate notification viewing functionality in their own dapp?
    * Using EPNS SDK [✅]
    * using EPNS dapp
    * Using EPNS Core smart contracts
    * Cannot be integrated.

# Receiving Notifications

Receiving notifications is a fairly simple process and can be done very easily.

As of now, EPNS allows you to receive notifications directly to your wallet addresses through the crypto front-ends, in the form of SNS Notifications etc.

## Receiving notifications via EPNS Crypto Front-ends
* [Using EPNS dapp](https://app.epns.io/)
* [Using extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/epns-protocol-alpha/lbdcbpaldalgiieffakjhiccoeebchmg)
* [Using Mobile App])(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.epns.epns&hl=en&gl=US)

## Receiving notifications via SNS

### What are SNS Notifications
SNS module for Push Delivery Nodes allows any developer to receive notifications, chats, or any other form of web3 communication directly to the platform they are building with the help of webhooks.

Hosted SNS Module is a mid-level solution that eliminates all the heavy load of running a node or syncing information and gives you webhooks that you implement to start receiving notifications, chats, or any other web3 communication in your software.

### How to get started with hosted SNS module?

Integrating the SNS module into your code takes less than 10 mins and contains just 3 steps:

1. **Step 1**: Implement a webhook to listen to AWS SNS. Here’s a boilerplate along with specs to get you npm installed and running: https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-sns-boilerplate
2. **Step 2**: You will need to open an endpoint either at a dedicated IP that listens to SNS or, if you are testing locally, have to expose the public endpoint for which tons of software is available.

> *Hint: For testing locally, You can also use ngrok to expose the public endpoint. If you use this with the boilerplate, the port needs to be 6000. The ngrok URL is now the SNS endpoint required in step 3*.

 **Step 3**: Once you set up this, you need to contact us by either shouting / tagging us on Discord or reaching out via the contact form. We need this as the SNS module requires whitelisting of your webhook endpoint.

> [EPNS Boiler Plate](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-sns-boilerplate) can also be used as a starting point to consume the feeds from the EPNS SNS Topic.

**Watch this quick video guide to ensure the right set-up**

[**SNS for Push Delivery Node**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VocGkaL0eEA)

## Questions

1. Is SNS module set-up a compulsory procedure to receive notifications?
    * Yes.
    * No, notifications can be received directly via EPNS crypto front-ends as well. [✅]

2. Why is SNS module useful?
    * Allows sending gasless transactions.
    * Simplifies the load for developers in order to receive notification. [✅]
    * Both

---
## Showrunners

The showrunners framework is a scaffold that developers can use to build out notifications for their use cases.

Showrunners framework provides the tools and helpers required for constructing the payload and sending the notification using the EPNS infrastructure.

Out-of-the-box showrunners provide the developer with a scheduling engine and libraries and helpers for easy access to blockchain data as well as web2 data sources.

### How to set-up a Hello World Channel using Showrunners?
Hello World channel exists to simply demonstrate how easy it is to send notifications in Web3.

To setup the channel, you will need to do the following steps:

* Ensure that you have [created your own channel](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/create-your-notif-channel) and make a ***note of the private key used for the same.***
* Head to `src/sample_showrunners` from the git clone of epns-showrunners-framework-staging which you had done earlier.
* Copy the folder helloWorld and drop it in src/showrunners folder.

> You might notice that the showrunners has already moved to complain about helloWorldKeys.json not containing the correct private key.

```
{
    "PRIVATE_KEY_1": "YOUR_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE"
}
```

* Simply copy and paste the private key of your channel instead of YOUR_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE and you should be presented with the following screen.
![](https://i.imgur.com/YmuQsYN.png)

### What does a Channel Structure looks like inside showrunners?
Each folder inside src/showrunners is treated as their own channel. Showrunners is designed to be a plug and play solution for your channel which means that each of the folders designated filenames are used to add-on various functionalities. You can have a look at all the files that are required to be inside your channel folder and it's structure here.

> Note: For example, we will assume that your are creating a channel called uniswap.

**Mandatory files required inside Channel directory**
At the very least, two files are required to be inside your channel directory:
1. channelChannel.js [.ts]
* For example: uniswapChannel.js | [Check file here](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework/blob/main/src/sample_showrunners/helloWorld/helloWorldKeys.json)
* This file contains all the logic functions of your channel, it can for instance have a way to poll all opted in users of your channel and based on certain conditions that are met, fire notifications out.

2. channelKeys.json
* For example: uniswapKeys.json | [Check file here](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework/blob/main/src/sample_showrunners/helloWorld/helloWorldKeys.json)
* This file contains all your private keys that you either belong to the channel you created or have authorized the wallets to send notification on your channel's behalf.


This is a normal json file, sample below:

```
{
    "PRIVATE_KEY_1": "YOUR_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE",
    "PRIVATE_KEY_2": "YOUR_DELEGATEE_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE",
    "PRIVATE_KEY_4": "YOUR_DELEGATEE_2_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE"
}
```

These two files inside your channel folder will ensure that your channel is correctly loaded in showrunners framework but it doesn't do any magic by itself.

Do ensure that your channel is triggering logic points either through cron job or through postman routes, you need ways to trigger that which leads us to the optional files that enables that.

**Optional files inside channel directory**

These files while optional enables certain trigger points for your channel to operate on.
1. channelRoutes.js [.ts]
* For example: uniswapRoutes.js | [Check file here](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework/blob/main/src/sample_showrunners/helloWorld/helloWorldRoutes.ts)
* This file contains the routes that you will enable to ensure you are able to manually trigger notification or any other logic points in your channelChannel.js [.ts]
You will ideally use the route of this files in postman to trigger logic functions / test them out.
2. channelJobs.js [.ts]
* For example: uniswapJobs.js |  [Check file here](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework/blob/main/src/sample_showrunners/helloWorld/helloWorldJobs.ts)
* This file contains your cron jobs to trigger logic points in your channelChannel.js [.ts]
The file is based on node-schedule and can handle a wide variety of automated cron jobs to enable sending wide array of notifications based on triggers.

3. channelAWSSNS.js[.ts]
For example: helloWorldAWSSNS.ts | [Check file here](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework/blob/main/src/sample_showrunners/helloWorld/helloWorldAWSSNS.ts)
This file contains the webhook helpers and handle the logic points for consuming a webhook.
This file is based on [AWS-SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc) and can handle the variety of logics for consuming webhook to enable sending wide array of notifications based on webhook triggers.

## Questions:
1. Which one of the following features is not provided by Showrunners?
    * Tools and Helpers required to create payloads
    * Creating a Channel on EPNS Protocol [✅]
    * Building out notifications for specific use cases.
    * All above-mentioned features are provided by showrunners.

2. Which of the following files not a compulsion in Channel Directory?
    * channelKeys.json
    * channelJobs.js [✅]
    * channelChannel.js
    * All of the above

3. Which of the following files(*in channel directory*) contains the actual logic of the channel?
    * channelChannel.js [✅]
    * channelJobs.js
    * channelKeys.json
    * None
