## What is EPNS

Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) is the worldâ€™s first decentralized communication & notification protocol for Web3.

Using the protocol, any smart contract, dapp, or backend service can send on-chain or off-chain notifications tied to the wallet addresses of users in a gasless, multichain, open, and platform-agnostic way.

Being an open communication middleware, notifications can be integrated and shown on any crypto wallet, mobile app, browser extension, or dapps enabling a native communication layer for Web3.
