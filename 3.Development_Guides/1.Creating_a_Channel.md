# Creating a Channel

Creating a channel is the very first step for sending notifications via EPNS.

Any wallet which activates itself on the EPNS Protocol to send a notification is called a Channel.

Using the EPNS dapp or our smart contracts, anyone with a wallet address on the Ethereum network can create their own channel. It can be deployed on:
* The Ethereum Mainnet (via[ Prod dapp](https://app.epns.io/)), or
* Kovan Test Network (via [Staging dapp](https://staging-app.epns.io/))

## Requirements for Setting Up a Channel
Ideally, there are 6 crucial requirements for creating a Channel.

1. A Channel Name
2. Channel Logo (an image of size 128px * 128px)
3. Alias Network (required for multi-chain, for example, if on Polygon, provide Polygon address of your contract, else can be left blank, currently supports only Polygon).

> *Important: This field needs to be provided at the very start in case you want to enable your channel on other blockchain networks, see for guides and to understand the process.*

4. A brief Channel Description (250 Characters)
5. Channel CTA (Call To Action link)
6. An amount of 50 DAI in your wallet (and some ETH )

> *If you are setting up a Channel on Staging dapp, you can get free DAI and Kovan ETH from the dapp & online faucets. No need for real DAI/ETH on the Staging app üòÅ*

## Enabling Channel on Other Chain
As previously mentioned, although channel creation happens on Ethereum itself, the protocol is designed to enable the channel to send notification on any chain.

This is exactly where Channel Alias set-up plays a major role.

### How to set up Channel Alias?
In order to set-up channel alias address for any preferred chain, one has to go through 2 simple steps:

* Selecting the chain and providing the right alias address for the channel during channel creation itself.
* Verification of the alias Address on the selected chain.
